# Testing documentation

- I have used Jest (Jest · 🃏 Delightful JavaScript Testing, n.d.) to test my code.
- To start testing, run `npm run test` and the tests will begin.

## Workflow/Action

- I have setup a GitHub workflow to run tests automatically on every commit.
- Despite the workflow being functional, due to the database being locally hosted, database tests will always fail.
